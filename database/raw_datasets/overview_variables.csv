ERA5;2m temperature;K;This parameter is the temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur. It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.;
ERA5;Mean surface net short-wave radiation flux;W m^-2;This parameter is the amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) that reaches a horizontal plane at the surface of the Earth (both direct and diffuse) minus the amount reflected by the Earth's surface (which is governed by the albedo). Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The remainder is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. This parameter is a mean over a particular time period (the processing period) which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the processing period is over the 1 hour ending at the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the processing period is over the 3 hours ending at the validity date and time. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.;
ERA5;Mean surface net long-wave radiation flux;W m^-2;Thermal radiation (also known as longwave or terrestrial radiation) refers to radiation emitted by the atmosphere, clouds and the surface of the Earth. This parameter is the difference between downward and upward thermal radiation at the surface of the Earth. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. The atmosphere and clouds emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface as downward thermal radiation. The upward thermal radiation at the surface consists of thermal radiation emitted by the surface plus the fraction of downwards thermal radiation reflected upward by the surface. This parameter is a mean over a particular time period (the processing period) which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the processing period is over the 1 hour ending at the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the processing period is over the 3 hours ending at the validity date and time. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.;
ERA5;Mean surface latent heat flux;W m^-2;This parameter is the transfer of latent heat (resulting from water phase changes, such as evaporation or condensation) between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere through the effects of turbulent air motion. Evaporation from the Earth's surface represents a transfer of energy from the surface to the atmosphere. This parameter is a mean over a particular time period (the processing period) which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the processing period is over the 1 hour ending at the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the processing period is over the 3 hours ending at the validity date and time. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.;
ERA5;Sea surface temperature;K;This parameter (SST) is the temperature of sea water near the surface. In ERA5, this parameter is a foundation SST, which means there are no variations due to the daily cycle of the sun (diurnal variations). SST, in ERA5, is given by two external providers. Before September 2007, SST from the HadISST2 dataset is used and from September 2007 onwards, the OSTIA dataset is used. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.;
ERA5;Sea-ice cover;Dimensionless;This parameter is the fraction of a grid box which is covered by sea ice. Sea ice can only occur in a grid box which includes ocean or inland water according to the land-sea mask and lake cover, at the resolution being used. This parameter can be known as sea-ice (area) fraction, sea-ice concentration and more generally as sea-ice cover. In ERA5, sea-ice cover is given by two external providers. Before 1979 the HadISST2 dataset is used. From 1979 to August 2007 the OSI SAF (409a) dataset is used and from September 2007 the OSI SAF oper dataset is used. Sea ice is frozen sea water which floats on the surface of the ocean. Sea ice does not include ice which forms on land such as glaciers, icebergs and ice-sheets. It also excludes ice shelves which are anchored on land, but protrude out over the surface of the ocean. These phenomena are not modelled by the IFS. Long-term monitoring of sea ice is important for understanding climate change. Sea ice also affects shipping routes through the polar regions.;
ERA5;Snow depth;m of water equivalent;This parameter is the amount of snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box. Its units are metres of water equivalent, so it is the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the whole grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.;
ERA5;Soil temperature level 1;K;This parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 1 (in the middle of layer 1). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer representation of soil, where the surface is at 0cm: Layer 1: 0 - 7cm, Layer 2: 7 - 28cm, Layer 3: 28 - 100cm, Layer 4: 100 - 289cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. Soil temperature is defined over the whole globe, even over ocean. Regions with a water surface can be masked out by only considering grid points where the land-sea mask has a value greater than 0.5. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15.;
ERA5;Soil temperature level 2;K;This parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 2 (in the middle of layer 2).

Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. Soil temperature is defined over the whole globe, even over ocean.
